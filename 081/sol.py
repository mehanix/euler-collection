PROBLEM STATEMENT

n the 5 by 5 matrix below, the minimal path sum from the top left
to the bottom right, by only moving to the right and down, is indicated
in bold red and is equal to 2427.

[
  [131, 673, 234, 103, 18],
  [201, 96, 342, 965, 150],
  [630, 803, 746, 422, 111],
  [537, 699, 497, 121, 956],
  [805, 732, 524, 37, 331],
]


Find the minimal path sum from the top left to the bottom right by only moving
right and down in matrix.txt (right click and "Save Link/Target As..."),
a 31K text file containing an 80 by 80 matrix.

SOLUTION

Let's approach this problem by using dynamic programming (DP)

* let matrix[i][j] = the value at line i and column j in the input matrix
* let min_sum[i][j] = the minimal path sum that can be obtained from the
  origin (0, 0) to (i, j), by only moving to the right or down
* we notice that min_sum[0][0] = the value in the origin = matrix[0][0]
* the relation of recursion is
  min_sum[i][j] = min(min_sum[i - 1][j], min_sum[i][j - 1])
  for i >= 0 and j >= 0
* the solution will be min_sum[n - 1][m - 1]

In my implementation I took a 'forward' approach and calculated
future states of the DP using the current state, instead of using
a 'backwards' approach by calculating the current state from past states.
