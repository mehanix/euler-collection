PROBLEM STATEMENT

Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way,
a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

37 36 35 34 33 32 31
38 17 16 15 14 13 30
39 18  5  4  3 12 29
40 19  6  1  2 11 28
41 20  7  8  9 10 27
42 21 22 23 24 25 26
43 44 45 46 47 48 49

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right
diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying
along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral
with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is
the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both
diagonals first falls below 10%?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SOLUTION

Let l(n) = the nth layer's side length

1. l(1) = 1
2. A new layer is formed by cloning the previous layer and
   shifting it in the corresponding direction (up, down, right, left) and then
   adding in the four corners. Moreover, l(n) = l(n - 1) + 2
3. To form the nth layer we proceed the following way:
    * insert next l(n-1) numbers
    * insert first corner
    * insert next l(n-1) numbers
    * insert second corner
    * insert next l(n-1) numbers
    * insert third corner
    * insert next l(n-1) numbers
    * insert last corner
5. For each layer we can recalculate the ratio and find the answer.
